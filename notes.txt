my notes on this prject:
----------------------------------------

// note: make your code compatible with laravel 5. for this check laravel 5.2 documentation

----------------------------------------------

// things to do tomorrow:

design the resources and breadcrumbs of the routes
create migration and table for messages
design the basic layout of the services view

create migration and table for services


day 2:

delete unused resource routes for services both in routes and controllers

create boilerplate 5 project
get their php ver
get their laravel version

let's forget about breadcrumbs for now 
and focus on something else

also we need frontend view and controller for contacts

what should i focus on?

create_file of services sound good 

final:

resolve all warnings, downgrade to laravel 5.2



creational notes:

they dont have breadcrumbs
they need new wysiwig
they have their own table template for data - use it

they don't have a multilingual support
